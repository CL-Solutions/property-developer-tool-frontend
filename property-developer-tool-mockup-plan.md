# Property Developer Tool - Mockup Foundation Plan

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive property developer management system that orchestrates the entire lifecycle from pre-acquisition assessment through sale and rental management. The system provides flexible property-level control where each project can either:
- Be handled with a sales partner through BlackVesto integration
- Be managed entirely in-house without external sales support
This flexibility allows developers to choose the best approach for each individual property.

## Core Objectives
- Streamline property acquisition decision-making with automated feasibility checks
- Enable seamless collaboration between developer and sales teams
- Provide real-time transparency on project status across all phases
- Automate document management and compliance tracking
- Integrate renovation/construction progress monitoring
- Support both sale and post-sale rental management workflows

## System Architecture Overview

### BlackVesto Data Structure Compatibility
The Property Developer Tool must maintain structural compatibility with BlackVesto's project-property hierarchy:

**Project (Building) Structure:**
- One project represents one building/address
- Contains multiple properties (individual units)
- Stores building-level data (energy, amenities, renovations)
- Has its own images and documents

**Property (Unit) Structure:**
- Always belongs to a project
- Unit identification (WE1, WE2, etc.)
- Individual pricing and rental data
- Can have additionally to the project images and documents
- Can have property-specific overrides for energy data
- Status tracking (active field for reservation status)
- Guaranteed rental price (Erstvermietungsgarantie) stored

**Key Compatibility Requirements:**
- Maintain project_id relationship for all properties
- Support the active status field for reservation synchronization

### Integration with BlackVesto Sales Platform
The Property Developer Tool will maintain **bidirectional real-time communication** with the BlackVesto Sales Platform, sharing:
- Property data and updates
- Document repositories
- Status changes and milestones
- Pricing and availability information
- Lead and customer data
- Transaction progress

### User Roles (Property Developer Tool)

### UI/UX Design Guidelines

**Color Scheme:**

- Partner Indicators:
  - BlackVesto: Brand blue
  - Internal: Neutral gray

**Layout Principles:**

- Toast notifications for status updates

**Component Library:**
- Use shadcn/ui as base
- Extend with custom property-specific components
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind classes
- Accessible form controls with proper labels

### Technical Implementation Notes

**State Management:**
- Use React Context for global app state
- Local state for form management
- Mock data served from JSON file initially
- Prepare for future API integration

**Current Routing Structure:**
```
Implemented Pages:
‚úÖ /dashboard - Main portfolio overview with projects
‚úÖ /projects - List all development projects  
‚úÖ /projects/[id] - Project detail with properties list
‚úÖ /projects/[id]/properties/new - Add property to project (with sidebar)
‚úÖ /properties/[id] - Individual property detail view
‚úÖ /pre-check - Quick property assessment with live traffic lights
‚úÖ /document-requests - Document request management page
‚úÖ /analytics - Performance metrics (placeholder with sidebar)

Pending Implementation:
‚è≥ /projects/new - Add new project (separate from pre-check)
‚è≥ /properties/[id]/documents - Document management detail
‚è≥ /properties/[id]/construction - Construction tracking detail
‚è≥ /properties/[id]/handover - Handover management
‚úÖ /notifications - Notification center (Implemented with shadcn/ui components)
‚è≥ /settings - App settings
```

**Mock API Endpoints:**
```javascript
// Property CRUD
GET /api/properties
POST /api/properties
GET /api/properties/[id]
PUT /api/properties/[id]
